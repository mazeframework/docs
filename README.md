# Introduction

Maze is a web development framework written in the Crystal language which implements the server-side MVC pattern using the object-oriented paradigm. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to those of us with experience in other web frameworks like Phoenix, Ruby on Rails or Python's Django.  Maze is based on [Amber](https://amberframework.org) and the purpose of Maze is to extend Amber with specific features and design goals that are outside of, and sometimes incompatible with, the core goals of the Amber project.  See the [Maze](https://github.com/mazeframework/maze) project on github for details about the main differences between Maze and Amber.

Maze aims to deliver developer happiness, productivity, and bare metal performance. The Crystal language is heavily inspired on Ruby delivering familiarity and productivity making it easy to read and write code with a lower learning curve for experienced Ruby developers.

Crystal also has some modern features like macros, concurrency model, union types, c bindings, built in dependency manager. Maze takes advantage of all these features providing you a familiar structure to develop a web application.

Maze offers a familiar set of tools for fast prototyping and developing enterprise-grade web applications, like Generators, Database management, CLI, Deployment tools, Docker support, Encrypted secrets, WebSockets, and more. If you come from the rails world, you will feel right at home but be aware, Maze is not Rails; it's type-safe, compiled, and embraces the best features from many different frameworks so you might notice pipes for routing which is more similar to Phoenix framework.

The aim of this introductory guide is to present a brief, high-level overview of Maze Framework, the parts that make it up, and the layers underneath that support it.
