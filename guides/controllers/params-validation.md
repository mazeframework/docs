# Params Validation

## Introduction

You will probably want to access data sent in by the user or other parameters in your controller actions. There are two types of parameters possible in a web application:

* The first type are parameters that are sent as part of the URL, called query string parameters. The query string is everything after "?" in the URL.
* The second type of parameter is usually referred to as POST data. This information usually comes from an HTML form which has been filled in by the user, and is called POST data because it can only be sent as part of an HTTP POST request.

## Example Usage

Maze does not make any distinction between query string parameters and POST parameters, and both are available in the `params` hash in your controller:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    unless params.valid?
      response.puts {errors: params.errors}.to_json
      response.status_code 400
    end

    user = User.new params.validate!
    user.save!

    @client = Client.new
    redirect_to :index
  end

  # Define parameters within actions
  def update
    update_params = params.validation do
      required(:name, "Your First Name is missing!") { |p| p.name? & !p.name.empty? }
      required(:email, "Your email address is invalid!") { |p| p.email? & p.size.between? 1..10 }
      required(:last_name) { |p| p.last_name? }
    end

    unless update_params.valid?
      response.puts {errors: params.errors}.to_json
      response.status_code 400
    end

    user = User.new update_params.validate!
    user.save!

    redirect_to :index
  end
end
```

With Maze parameter validation, it's easy to keep your code organized:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  include UserParams

  def create
    unless UserParams.create.valid?
      response.puts {errors: params.errors}.to_json
      response.status_code 400
    end

    user = User.new UserParams.create.validate!
    user.save!

    @client = Client.new
    redirect_to :index
  end

  # Define parameters per actions
  def update
    unless UserParams.update.valid?
      response.puts {errors: params.errors}.to_json
      response.status_code 400
    end

    user = User.new UserParams.update.validate!
    user.save!

    redirect_to :index
  end
end
```
