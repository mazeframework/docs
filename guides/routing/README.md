# Routing

The Maze router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.

## Pipelines

A _pipeline_ is a set of of transformations that is performed to a HTTP request. These transformations come in the form of a pipe. A _pipe_ is a _\*\*_class which includes [`HTTP::Handler`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/latest/HTTP/Handler.html) and implements the [`#call`](https://crystal-lang.org/api/latest/HTTP/Handler.html#call%28context%3AHTTP%3A%3AServer%3A%3AContext%29-instance-method) method. You can use a handler to intercept any incoming request and modify the response. These can be used for request throttling, ip-based whitelisting, adding custom headers.

## Routes

Routing provides you tools that map URLs to controller actions. By defining routes, you can separate how your application is implemented from how its URLâ€™s are structured, Routes wire up real-time web socket handlers, and define a series of pipeline transformations for scoping middleware to sets of routes.
