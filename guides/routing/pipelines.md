# Pipelines

A _pipeline_ is a set of of transformations that is performed to a HTTP request. These transformations come in the form of a pipe. A _pipe_ is a class which includes [HTTP::Handler](https://crystal-lang.org/api/latest/HTTP/Handler.html) and implements the [\#call](https://crystal-lang.org/api/latest/HTTP/Handler.html#call%28context%3AHTTP%3A%3AServer%3A%3AContext%29-instance-method) method.

You can use a handler to intercept any incoming request and modify the response. These can be used for request throttling, ip-based whitelisting, adding custom headers.

Every Maze application needs to define a _pipeline_ with a set of _pipes_ each pipeline allow a set of transformations to be applied to different sets of route, this give you granular control and explicitness of which transformation to run for each of the requests.

```ruby
Maze::Server.configure do |app|
  pipeline :web do
    # Plug is the method to use connect a pipe (middleware)
    # A plug accepts an instance of HTTP::Handler
    # plug Maze::Pipe::Params.new
    plug Maze::Pipe::Logger.new
    plug Maze::Pipe::Flash.new
    plug Maze::Pipe::Session.new
    plug Maze::Pipe::CSRF.new
  end

  # All static content will run these transformations
  pipeline :static do
    plug HTTP::StaticFileHandler.new("./public")
    plug HTTP::CompressHandler.new
  end

  routes :static do
    # Each route is defined as follow
    # Verb resource : String, controller : Symbol, action : Symbol
    get "/*", StaticController, :index
  end

  routes :web do
    get "/", HomeController, :static
  end
end
```

Above we define a pipeline called `:web` as you can see the `:web` pipeline transforms the request using a _Logger_, _StaticFileHandler_ and a _CompressHandler_, all of which extends from the Crystal [_HTTP::Handler_](https://crystal-lang.org/api/latest/HTTP/Handler.html) class.

Maze provides us some default pipes for a number of common tasks. In turn we can customize them as well as create new pipelines to meet our needs.

* **Pipe::Static** serves static assets
* **Pipe::Logger** logs incoming requests
* **Pipe::CORS** Handler adds support for Cross Origin Resource Sharing.
* **Pipe::CSRF** Handler adds support for Cross Site Request Forgery.
* **Pipe::Error** Handler catches RouteNotFound and returns.
* **Pipe::Flash** handler provides a mechanism to pass flash message between
* **Pipe::Session** a plug that sets up session management.

With our `:web` pipeline now define we can use it in our routes definitions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't get rid of `StaticController` if you need to serve static assets.

## Sharing Pipelines

If you have two pipelines that share a lot of the same pipes, you can assign the shared pipes in one block: `pipeline :web, :auth do ... end`

Full example for `config/routes.cr`:

```ruby
Maze::Server.configure do |app|
  pipeline :web, :auth do
    plug Maze::Pipe::Logger.new
    plug Maze::Pipe::Flash.new
    plug Maze::Pipe::Session.new
    plug Maze::Pipe::CSRF.new
  end

  pipeline :auth do
    plug Authenticate.new
  end

  routes :web do
    get "/", HomeController, :static
  end

  routes :auth do
    get "/admin", AdminController, :dashboard
  end
end
```
